# Lumina - File Converter for FE9 / FE10
I've written various scripts to do format conversions for Tellius formats throughout [Paragon's]() development. Lumina provides a UI for running the same scripts to make things easier.

Supported features:
* Pack and unpack `.cmp` archives
* Pack and unpack `.m` files
* Convert `.bin` files a text format for easier reading
* LZ10 compression / decompression
